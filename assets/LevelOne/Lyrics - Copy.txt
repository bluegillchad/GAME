How much more do you think it takes?
They're only here to sell you lies, it’s no surprise
'Cause every day I've been waiting for some kind of break
Searching for permanence
A place that I can go to make me whole
But the shadows keep whispering to me
But the shadows keep whispering to me
I’m always waiting for the tide to crash through me
I tremble with every wave
Make me whole again
If I let go, could I still trust you to be better on your own?
If I let you stay, you will ruin everything
You're making me hate a world so good to me
If I let you stay, you will ruin everything
When even good times are bittersweet
And though at times it seems like a nightmare on repeat
All you have to do is breathe and know that
This is our home now, you and I will never be alone
When you fall down, take my hand, don't let me go
This is our home now, you and I will never be alone
When you fall down, I am yours to hold
I'm always waiting for the tide to crash through me
I tremble with every wave
Make me whole again
If I let go, could I still trust you to be better on your own?
If I let you stay, you will ruin everything
You're making me hate a world so good to me
If I let you stay, you will ruin everything
The loneliest dreams appear in open air
With the sun in my face
The loneliest dreams I have appear when I'm awake
With a smile on my face, I live to kill the ache
