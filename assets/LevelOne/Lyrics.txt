21500 1 How much more do you think it takes?
25500 2 They're only here to sell you lies, 
it's no surprise.
34500 2 'Cause every day
I've been waiting for some kind of break.
38000 1 Searching for permanence.
40500 1 A place that I can go to make me whole.
47000 1 But the shadows keep whispering to me.
54000 1 But the shadows keep whispering to me.
63500 2 I'm always waiting for the tide 
to crash through me.
68000 1 I tremble with every wave.
72000 1 Make me whole again.
74500 1 If I let go,
76700 2 Could I still trust you to 
be better on your own?
82500 2 If I let you stay,
you will ruin everything.
89500 2 You're making me hate a world,
so good to me.
96000 2 If I let you stay,
you will ruin everything.
117000 1 When even good times are bittersweet.
120800 2 And though at times it seems like
a nightmare on repeat.
126500 2 All you have to do
is breathe and know that.
130000 2 This is our home now,
you and I will never be alone.
134000 2 When you fall down,
take my hand, don't let me go.
137000 2 This is our home now,
you and I will never be alone.
141000 2 When you fall down,
I am yours to hold.
146000 2 I'm always waiting for the tide 
to crash through me.
150500 1 I tremble with every wave.
154600 1 Make me whole again.
156700 1 If I let go,
159000 2 Could I still trust you to 
be better on your own?
165000 2 If I let you stay,
you will ruin everything.
171000 2 You're making me hate a world,
so good to me.
178500 2 If I let you stay,
you will ruin everything.
199000 1 The loneliest dreams appear in open air.
207000 1 With the sun in my face.
212000 2 The loneliest dreams I have 
appear when I'm awake.
221000 1 With a smile on my face,
224000 1 I live to kill the ache.
