3600 1The weight of the world is resting on thin ice
6200 1When the surface breaks, will I find paradise?
9200 1As I freeze to death, left to reflect
12300 1What a waste of time I was in retrospect
16500 1I'd take a leap of faith, but I'd lose my nerve
22000 1In the end, I'll get the hell that I deserve
26500 1I'm always gone with the wind
31500 1Crawling in and out of my mind
36500 1God knows I lost all my faith
42000 1A sickness with no remedy
45500 1Except the ones inside of me
51000 2You ever wonder how deep 
you could sink into nothing at all?
59000 1Disintegrate, annihilate me
66000 1 
70000 1Annihilate
72000 1Do you remember when you said to me?
75000 1"My friend, hope is a prison"

82500 1Hope is a prison
85000 1BLEGH
85500 1 
91000 1Of all the patterns that I could create
93500 1I built a labyrinth with no escape
97000 1To keep myself under lock and key
100000 1I am my own worst enemy
104000 1I'd take a leap of faith, but I'd lose my nerve
109000 1In the end, I'll get the hell that I deserve
114000 1I'm always gone with the wind
119000 1Crawling in and out of my mind
124000 1God knows I lost all my faith
129500 1A sickness with no remedy
133000 1Except the ones inside of me
138500 2You ever wonder how deep 
you could sink into nothing at all?
146500 1Disintegrate, annihilate me
154000 1A sickness with no remedy
157500 1Except the ones inside of me
163500 2You ever wonder how deep 
you could sink into nothing at all?
171000 1Disintegrate, annihilate me
179000 1If I could silence all the doubt in me
182000 1Accept that what is meant to be 
188000 2You ever wonder how deep 
you could sink into nothing at all?
196000 1Disintegrate, annihilate me
202000 1 
209000 1I remember when you said to me
